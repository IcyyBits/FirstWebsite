     <p>Hello everyone. This page is all about myself. While coding this page, i could not access my keyboard's autocorrect feature, so don't shame me for any mistakes. <br />
     Alright. Let's begin. <br />
     My name is Mahie
     I am a student, studying for HSC.
     Pray that I do well. <br />
     So why am I creating this webpage? That's a good question. I would like to know the answer for myself. Parhaps I'm just bored or I don't have anything to do. Both of those statements mean the same. But for me, they do have a slight diffirence. I won't be explaining that. There are things that i hate to do. Explaining is one of them <br />
     Oh I wanna show you my pic. wait wait. where is it at? i...can't seem to find it. hmmm... oh i found it. look look it't me!</p> <br />
